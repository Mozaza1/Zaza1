<h2><em>what is self love</em> </h2>
<p> According to me, self<font color="blue"> love </font> is when someone is in love with himself and doesn't what anything more from himself.<br>
Unlike other people who do staffs to anoy someone,he does it only for himself and doesnt need other for himself
<p> I always wonder what people like saying about me but I usualy don't worry about anyting </p>
